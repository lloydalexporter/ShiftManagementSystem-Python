# Shift Management System for Sling shifts.

Export the CSV file from Sling on the web, run the `_MainProgram.py` Python file, and navigate the CLI to import the CSV and view data on it.

At some point I will write a better one of these...

To Note, I use macOS, I had Shortcuts to import these shifts into my Calendar, and I'm no longer at the job were I used this so will likely not come back to this.
Feel free to do whatever with this.
